An example code to demonstrate
a) how to create a Makefile to link to UQTk libraries,
b) how to perform model parameter inference given a user-defined, C++ forward function.

Note: The first few lines of Makefile need to be edited to point to 
UQTk installation location, fortran libraries, C/C++ compilers specific to user's computer.
